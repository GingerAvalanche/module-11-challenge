# Homework Assignment Module 10 - Splinter and BeautifulSoup

## Description

`part_1_mars_news.ipynb` reads Mars news article descriptions using Splinter and BeautifulSoup and compiles short summaries about them.

`part_2_mars_weather.ipynb` reads Martian atmospheric pressure and minimum temperature over the course of 2021 Earth days, calculating basic statistics and graphing data to estimate the length of a Martian year.

## Notes

The answers to the analysis questions were already given in the starter code. However, one of those answers was correct but had arrived at the conclusion via erroneous data. I commented about it inside `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`.
